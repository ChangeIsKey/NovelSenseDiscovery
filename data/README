=== The Package ===

├──ares_bert_large.txt
└──ares_bert_base_multilingual.txt

This directory contains ARES' embeddings in the English (ares_bert_large.txt) and multilingual version (ares_bert_base_multilingual.txt)

The embedding file is in the word2vec format:
_the first line contains two values separated by space containing the number of vectors in the file and the size of the vectors. 
_each subsequent line represents a vector where elements are separated by space and the first component is the id of the sense and the other components are the features.

The embeddings for the English version are computed with BERT large cased and have dimensionality 2048. Their id is the WordNet sense key (https://wordnet.princeton.edu/documentation/senseidx5wn).
The embeddings for the multilingual version are computed with BERT base multilingual cased and have dimensionality 1536. Their id is the BabelNet synset id.
